description: 'My name is Darrel Webber. And upon hearing it, prior to meeting me, most get the impression that I might be a westerner or someone from the northern hemisphere. I get that; a lot! All my life. Its only when people meet me that they realise I am most certainly none-of-the-above. When I was younger, I found it to be a pain. Now, I leverage the confusion and use it as a useful icebreaker. I take the opprtunity to explain that I am, in fact, born and raised in Sabah, North Borneo (The Malaysian bit of Borneo) and for the most part, I consider myself to be from one of the indigenous tribes of Borneo, the Kadazan. The "western" surname came from my British ancestor (4 generations before me) who found himself in India and then his progeny made their way to Malaysia.'
