About Me

My name suggests that I might be a westerner or someone from the northern hemisphere. I get that; a lot! All my life. Its only when people meet me that they realise I am most certainly none-of-the-above. When I was younger, I found it to be a pain. Now, I leverage the confusion and use it as a useful icebreaker. I explain that I am in fact born and raised in North Borneo (The Malaysian bit of Borneo) and for the most part, I consider myself as from the indigenous community of Borneo. The "western" surname came from my British ancestor (4 generations before me) who found himself in India and then his progeny made their way to Malaysia. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0d578e5a-9a9e-44e0-bfbb-ef001657e7b6.jpg)

I posted this lovely infographic on social media several months ago and got the attention of many. It, very simply, encapsulates, what I feel about being proactive in life. However, the BIG question that, I find most people, find hard to answer is "_WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY_?" I think it is life's most crucial question. And most don't spend enough time thinking of the answer.
